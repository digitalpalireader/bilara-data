“Legal question” or “deciding”—are these things associated or dissociated,
and is it possible, having analysed these things again and again, to point to a difference between them?
“Legal question” or “deciding”—these things are dissociated, not associated,
and it is possible to point to a difference between them—
this should certainly not be said.

“Legal question” or “deciding”—these things are associated, not dissociated,
and it is not possible, having analysed these things again and again, to point to a difference between them.
What is the reason for this?
Was it not said by the Lord:
“There are, monks, these four legal questions and seven decidings.
Legal questions are settled by decidings; decidings are settled by legal questions.
Thus these things are associated, not dissociated,
and it is not possible … to point to a difference between them.”
